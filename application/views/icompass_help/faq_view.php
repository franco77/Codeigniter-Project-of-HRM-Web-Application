										<p>The next page is the (intranet) home page which is the central page from where you can navigate to all other pages. The homepage has the following tabs: "Home" "Timesheet" " Production" "New and Events" "Resources" "I compass help". Several of these tabs are under construction. The different tabs are explained below. If you work in HR, Admin/Accounts or BD, a separate site will be visible to you with links and resources related to your area of work. For sharing of documents you can also use the existing "resources" page.</p>
										<p>The most prominent section is the yellow “Alert section”. In this section alerts and important announcements appear.  For example, If you did not log in the previous day or days, an alert will pop up that will ask you whether you would like to regularize your attendance. (You can also do this soon by going to the timesheet tab and click the button "regularize attendance"). Other alerts include for example any current internal job openings or announcements of staff activities. </p>
										<p>The homepage includes the additional "key" features (repeated from the other tabs) in 6 categories</p>
										<ol type="1">

										<p>Our AABSyS intranet site is best viewed in all browsers <strong>except Internet Explorer Version6</strong> (because HTML does not support it). It is our request to those of you who are using lower versions to please upgrade to Internet Explorer v8, v9 or v10. The download link is the following:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/india/windows/ie/IE8.aspx?os=WinXP&browser=Firefox">http://www.microsoft.com/india/windows/ie/IE8.aspx?os=WinXP&browser=Firefox</a> </p>
										<p>In order to ensure uniformity in our approach, <strong>we ask that you make this link</strong> <a href="http://icompass.polosoftech.com">http://icompass.polosoftech.com</a> <strong>your default page</strong> in your web browser so that you will automatically come to the AABSyS intranet page (default page). We have attached three mock ups on how to set up the default page to the intranet site in the different browsers.</p>

										<p>After you login, a pop up will appear asking you whether you would like to update your attendance. Click "yes" if this is your first login of the day. If you say "yes" the system will record the login date (at a later stage it will also record the login time). Use "No" only in case you have come to the office on a leave day and don't need to record your attendance. Once you have recorded your attendance for today, you will not be asked again - even if you log out.</p>
